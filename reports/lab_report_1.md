# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Disaster Response Platform (DaRP)

**Date:** 03.10.2023

## Progress Summary

**Our objective for the following week** is to review the requirements and organize them in the appropriate format; then accordingly updating the use-case, class, and sequence diagrams. We will also define the technologies to be used by the Mobile, Back-end, and Front-end teams. Additionally, we will update the Wiki pages and issues. Moreover, we will evaluate the feedback received to minimize the mistakes made by the team in the previous semester.

## Risks

- Updates on requirements may be too much, therefore time for updating the use-case, class diagrams and sequence diagrams will be over
- Extended user roles (e.g., facilitator, responder) may require additional fields that we did not consider in the initial design. We will address these issues as they arise.
- Participants who select a team can not have enough knowledge, they can spend much time learning technologies.
